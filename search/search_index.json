Still, you can use most of them (potentially with slightly reduced functionality) with any other virtual lab environment or on physical gear. For the rest of this document, we\u2019ll assume you decided to use netlab ; if you want to set up your lab in some other way, read the Manual Setup section of the BGP Labs documentation. Warning IS-IS labs work best with netlab release 1.8.4 or later. If you\u2019re using an earlier netlab release, please upgrade with pip3 install --upgrade networklab . Select the Network Devices You Will Work With You can run FRRouting in all netlab -supported virtualization environments (VirtualBox, libvirt, or Docker) 2 , and if you want to start practicing IS-IS with minimum hassle, consider using FRRouting for all lab devices. You can even run FRRouting containers on Macbooks with Apple silicon . If you\u2019d like to use a more traditional networking device, use any other netlab -supported device for which we implemented basic IS-IS configuration as the device to practice with 1 . I recommend Arista cEOS or Nokia SR Linux containers; they are the easiest ones to install and use. Tip If you plan to run the labs in free GitHub Codespaces , you MUST use container-based network devices like Arista cEOS, FRR, Nokia SR Linux, or Vyos. Select the Additional Devices in Your Lab Some labs use additional routers \u2013 preconfigured devices with which your routers exchange routing information. You won\u2019t configure those devices, but you might have to log into them and execute show commands. The default setup uses FRRouting for additional routers; we also generated all the show printouts with FRRouting. Alternatively, you can use any other device for which we implemented basic IS-IS configuration as additional routers. Additional limitations (should they exist) are listed under the Device Requirements section of individual lab exercises. Select the Virtualization Environment Now that you know which network device to use, check which virtualization environment you can use. Running IS-IS labs in a free GitHub Codespace is an excellent starting point, but if you decide to build your own infrastructure, containerlab is easier to set up than libvirt , with virtualbox being a distant third. Now for a few gotchas: You can use virtualbox if you want to run the lab devices as virtual machines on your Windows- or MacOS laptop with Intel CPU, but even then, I\u2019d prefer running them in a Ubuntu VM . Your hardware and virtualization software (for example, VirtualBox or VMware Fusion) must support nested virtualization if you want to use libvirt on that Ubuntu VM. You don\u2019t need nested virtualization to run Docker containers unless you\u2019re using the crazy trick we\u2019re forced to use for Juniper vMX or Nokia SR OS \u2013 they\u2019re running as a virtual machine within a container . Software Installation Based on the choices you made, you\u2019ll find the installation instructions in one of these documents: Using GitHub Codespaces Ubuntu VM Installation on Windows or MacOS Ubuntu Server Installation Running netlab on any other Linux Server Running netlab in a Public Cloud Running netlab on Apple silicon Discouraged: Virtualbox-Based Lab on Windows or MacOS Once you have completed the software installation you have to deal with the stupidities of downloading and installing network device images ( Virtualbox , libvirt , containers ) unless you decided to use FRR, Nokia SR Linux, or Vyos. I would love to simplify the process, but the networking vendors refuse to play along. Even worse, their licenses prohibit me from downloading the images and creating a packaged VM with preinstalled network devices for you 3 . Fortunately, you only have to go through this colossal waste of time once. Setting Up the Labs We finally got to the fun part \u2013 setting up the labs. If you\u2019re not using GitHub Codespaces: Select a directory where you want to have the IS-IS labs Clone the isis GitHub repository with git clone https://github.com/bgplab/isis.git . GitHub UI gives you other options in the green Code button, including Download ZIP After you get a local copy of the repository: If needed, edit the defaults.yml file in the top directory to set your preferred network device and virtualization environment. For example, I\u2019m using the following settings to run the labs with Arista EOS containers while using FRRouting as the external IS-IS routers: device: eos # Change to your preferred network device provider: clab # Change to virtualbox or libvirt if needed groups: external: device: frr # Change to your preferred external router In a terminal window, change the current directory to one of the lab directories (for example, basic/1-simple-ipv4 ), and execute netlab up . Wait for the lab to start and use netlab connect to connect to individual lab devices Have fun. When you\u2019re done, collect the device configurations with netlab collect (if you want to save them) and shut down the lab with netlab down Change the current directory to another lab directory and repeat. Once you run out of lab exercises, create a new one and contribute it with a pull request ;) Most network devices require an x86 CPU. You must run the labs on a device with an x86 CPU (Intel or AMD) to use them. \u21a9 There is no official FRR virtual machine image \u2013 netlab has to download and install FRR on a Ubuntu VM whenever you start an frr node as a virtual machine.

The scalability of a routing protocol and the reduced memory footprint on the edge (access) routers were crucial. OSPF solved that conundrum with areas , and IS-IS solved it with multi-level topology; some IS-IS routers know only about prefixes in their area ( level-1 routers), while others know the whole network topology ( level-2 routers), but might not be aware of the internal structure of other areas. Decent modern IS-IS implementations have no problems running a single-level IS-IS network with hundreds of routers, and the memory requirements are usually a non-issue. However, you might still find edge cases where a multi-level deployment might be beneficial. For example, your edge switches might have small hardware forwarding tables, or you might want to limit the blast radius of network failures \u2013 IS-IS limits the LSP flooding to a single area (or the level-2 backbone) 1 . In this exercise, you\u2019ll explore multi-level IS-IS deployment using a simple 5-router topology: Device Requirements Use any device supported by the netlab IS-IS configuration module that correctly implements the distribution of intra-area (level-1) routes into inter-area (level-2) backbone. Unfortunately, this leaves FRRouting off the table. As of August 2025, FRRouting\u2019s IS-IS implementation is incomplete and does not propagate level-1 IP prefixes into the level-2 LSP database as required by RFC 1195 . Nevertheless, the implemented parts are solid, and FRR can be used without problems in single-level IS-IS deployments. Starting the Lab You can start the lab on your own lab infrastructure or in GitHub Codespaces ( more details ): Change directory to advanced/1-multiarea Execute netlab up Log into lab devices with netlab connect Existing Device Configuration When starting the lab, netlab configures IPv4 addresses and IS-IS protocol on the lab routers. All five routers are configured as L2 IS-IS routers, as recommended in Configure IS-IS Routing for IPv4 . This results in a flat level-2 multi-area topology. Routers use the following areas: Node Router ID IS-IS Area r1 10.0.0.1 49.0100 c1 10.0.0.2 49.0100 c2 10.0.0.3 49.0100 x1 10.0.0.4 49.0001 x2 10.0.0.5 49.0002 Initial Routing Tables After starting the lab, you should have full reachability between all routers\u2019 loopback interfaces. For example, router R1 has a full topological view of the network. Its routing table is also relatively large, even for our small network of 5 routers. Now imagine a network with hundreds of routers, each advertising tens of networks. Remember that in past times, people were rightfully concerned about the routing (and forwarding) table size in a single-level network, and you can quickly see the need for smaller forwarding tables. IS-IS routes on R1 running Arista cEOS r1#show ip route isis VRF: default Source Codes: I L1 - IS-IS level 1, I L2 - IS-IS level 2, ....

Make router R1 a level-1 IS-IS router. The configuration command you need should be pretty familiar (after all, you configured the routers to be level-2 routers in one of the early lab exercises ). Examine the R1 routing table once it\u2019s configured as a level-1 router. IS-IS routes on R1 (Arista cEOS) running as a level-1 router r1#show ip route isis VRF: default Source Codes: I L1 - IS-IS level 1, I L2 - IS-IS level 2, .... We lost all IS-IS routes. Let\u2019s figure out what went wrong, starting with the IS-IS interfaces and IS-IS adjacencies: R1 (Arista cEOS) runs IS-IS on two Ethernet interfaces, but has no IS-IS adjacencies r1#show isis interface brief IS-IS Instance: Gandalf VRF: default Interface Level IPv4 Metric IPv6 Metric Type Adjacency --------- ----- ----------- ----------- -------------- --------- Loopback0 L1 10 10 loopback (passive) Ethernet2 L1 10 10 point-to-point 0 Ethernet1 L1 10 10 point-to-point 0 r1#show isis neighbors Let\u2019s restore the lost adjacencies. Before doing that, we need a short detour through the IS-IS adjacency rules to understand why R1 lost all its neighbors. Level-1 and Level-2 Adjacency Rules in IS-IS As already mentioned, IS-IS uses areas (level-1 routing) connected via an overlay inter-area routing topology (level-2 routing). In many ways, the inter-area overlay is similar to an OSPF backbone, but with many significant differences. Every router can participate in intra-area routing (level-1 router), inter-area routing (level-2 router), or both (level-1-2 router). In OSPF, all inter-area traffic must go through area zero (the backbone area). Any other area must connect to the backbone area, resulting in a strict hierarchical network. Consequently, border routers must have at least one interface in the backbone area. Compared to OSPF, IS-IS has more flexible requirements. Backbone routers (L2 routers), often referred to as \u201ctransit routers\u201d in IS-IS parlance, are not required to be part of a \u201ctransit area\u201d or belong to the same area. The only requirement imposed on an IS-IS transit network is the end-to-end level-2 continuity through L2 adjacencies across all transit routers. Both L2 and L1/L2 routers can ensure the required level-2 continuity. The rules governing adjacency formation in IS-IS are simple: Level-1 (intra-area) routers) only form adjacencies with level-1 or level-1-2 routers in the same area. A direct consequence of this is that they cannot be border routers. Level-2 routers form L2 adjacencies with other level-2 routers, or with level-1-2 routers. They can form adjacencies with routers in other areas. This is important; the only way to connect two different areas in IS-IS is through an L2 adjacency. Level-1-2 routers can form both L1 and L2 adjacencies. They maintain a separate topological database for each of those levels. They act as border routers and manifest many similarities with the OSPF Area Border Routers. The adjacency that two routers try to establish depends on their configuration. You can specify the router type in the IS-IS routing process, or limit the adjacency type on a single interface with an interface configuration command. The two parameters limit the IS-IS hellos (ISH) sent through an interface 2 , thus directly limiting the adjacencies formed through that interface. Make C1 and C2 Level-1-2 Routers Now that you know the rules, it\u2019s easy to see why R1 lost its adjacency with C1 and C2. A level-1 router cannot form an adjacency with a level-2 router. To fix the problem, change the IS-IS router type of C1 and C2 to level-1-2. Again, the command to do that should be familiar by now. When you are done, check the IS-IS adjacencies on R1 to see if you solved the adjacency problem we found at the end of the previous configuration task.

Next, check if we managed to reduce the size of the routing table: IS-IS database on R1 running Arista cEOS r1#show isis database Legend: H - hostname conflict U - node unreachable IS-IS Instance: Gandalf VRF: default IS-IS Level 1 Link State Database LSPID Seq Num Cksum Life Length IS Received LSPID Flags r1.00-00 7 24422 834 118 L1 0000.0000.0001.00-00 <> c1.00-00 4 12846 835 131 L2 0000.0000.0002.00-00 <DefaultAtt> c2.00-00 4 61785 835 131 L2 0000.0000.0003.00-00 <DefaultAtt> You will immediately notice that R1 lost the full topological view of the network. The IS-IS database contains only LSPs originated by C1, C2, and R1. Finally, examine the R1 routing table: IS-IS routes on R1 r1#show ip route isis VRF: default I L1 - IS-IS level 1, I L2 - IS-IS level 2, ... Gateway of last resort: I L1 0.0.0.0/0 [115/10] via 10.1.0.1, Ethernet1 via 10.1.0.5, Ethernet2 I L1 10.0.0.2/32 [115/20] via 10.1.0.1, Ethernet1 I L1 10.0.0.3/32 [115/20] via 10.1.0.5, Ethernet2 I L1 10.1.0.8/30 [115/20] via 10.1.0.1, Ethernet1 via 10.1.0.5, Ethernet2 I L1 10.1.0.12/30 [115/20] via 10.1.0.1, Ethernet1 I L1 10.1.0.16/30 [115/20] via 10.1.0.5, Ethernet2 Observe that the type of IS-IS routes changed from L2 to L1, and X1/X2 loopbacks are no longer in the routing table. The routing table accurately reflects the fact that R1 lost visibility of the level-2 network topology. The reduction in the IP routing table size is trivial at the scale of a 5-router lab, but as you can easily imagine, it can be significant in large networks. Since we\u2019re aiming to optimize the R1 routing and not to fragment the network, let\u2019s confirm that we still have reachability to routers in other areas: Inter-area connectivity tests on R1 r1#ping 10.0.0.4 PING 10.0.0.4 (10.0.0.4) 72(100) bytes of data. 80 bytes from 10.0.0.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=0.479 ms 80 bytes from 10.0.0.4: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=0.144 ms .... r1#ping 10.0.0.5 PING 10.0.0.5 (10.0.0.5) 72(100) bytes of data. 80 bytes from 10.0.0.5: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=0.801 ms 80 bytes from 10.0.0.5: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=0.345 ms .... Despite no longer having a route to X1 and X2\u2019s loopbacks, R1 can still reach them. Astute engineers might have already noticed something interesting in the R1 routing table: an ECMP default route pointing towards C1 and C2. This route is used for L2 default routing, and it\u2019s the key to reaching the level-2 backbone and, implicitly, other IS-IS areas. Let\u2019s see how this default route is created. L2 Default Routing Mechanics We\u2019ll start our exploration at C1. Here\u2019s its level-1 LSP database: IS-IS level-1 database on C1, running Arista cEOS c1#show isis database level-1 Legend: H - hostname conflict U - node unreachable IS-IS Instance: Gandalf VRF: default IS-IS Level 1 Link State Database LSPID Seq Num Cksum Life Length IS Received LSPID Flags r1.00-00 18 32061 726 118 L1 0000.0000.0001.00-00 <> c1.00-00 20 6734 1193 120 L2 0000.0000.0002.00-00 <DefaultAtt> c2.00-00 20 6712 1193 120 L2 0000.0000.0003.00-00 <DefaultAtt> Notice that the LSPs originated by C1 and C2 have the ATT flag set. The full name of this flag is \u201cAttached\u201d, and in the words of ISO_IEC_10589_2002, a level-1-2 router considers itself attached when it can reach at least one other area using the corresponding routeing metric, or It has at least one enabled reachable address prefix with the corresponding metric defined. If a router considers itself attached, it will originate L1 LSPs with the ATT flag set. This has the following effects: The ATT flag signals level-1 routers in the same area that the router advertising it can carry traffic to the level-2 backbone and into other areas. The level-1-2 router advertises itself as an exit point from a level-1 area. Level-1 routers receiving an LSP with the ATT bit set will insert a default route pointing to the router that sent the LSP into their IP routing table. Back to the default routes we saw earlier in R1\u2019s routing table. In our topology, both C1 and C2 consider themselves attached to the level-2 backbone, and they both originate L1 LSPs with the ATT bit set. Router R1 has ECMP enabled by default, so it uses both C1 and C2 as the exit points from the level-1 area and adds two default routes to its IP routing table. Distribution of L1 Routes into L2 Backbone We have already checked that R1 can reach routers in other areas (X1 and X2), but there is another part of the puzzle that needs to be explored: how do X1 and X2 know about R1? After all, they are in different areas, and know nothing about the internal structure of R1\u2019s area (49.0100) IS-IS solves this problem by automatically distributing level-1 prefixes into level-2 LSPs on level-1-2 routers. Straight from RFC 1195: Level 2 routers include in their level 2 LSPs a complete list of [IP address, subnet mask, metric] specifying all IP addresses reachable in their area. As described in section 3, this information may be obtained from a combination of the level 1 LSPs (obtained from level-1 routers in the same area) and/or by manual configuration. Distributing intra-area information into L2 LSP allows routers from other areas to reach destinations within the area. Let\u2019s check whether C1 is doing the right thing and inspect the contents of its level-1 and level-2 LSP databases: R1 LSP as observed in the IS-IS level-1 database on C1 (running Arista cEOS) c1#show isis database level-1 r1.00-00 detail Legend: H - hostname conflict U - node unreachable IS-IS Instance: Gandalf VRF: default IS-IS Level 1 Link State Database LSPID Seq Num Cksum Life Length IS Received LSPID Flags r1.00-00 15 20334 1148 118 L1 0000.0000.0001.00-00 <> LSP received time: 2025-08-12 13:50:15 Remaining lifetime received: 1199 s Modified to: 1200 s NLPID: 0xCC(IPv4) Hostname: r1 Area addresses: 49.0100 Interface address: 10.1.0.6 Interface address: 10.1.0.2 Interface address: 10.0.0.1 IS Neighbor : c2.00 Metric: 10 IS Neighbor : c1.00 Metric: 10 Reachability : 10.1.0.4/30 Metric: 10 Type: 1 Up Reachability : 10.1.0.0/30 Metric: 10 Type: 1 Up Reachability : 10.0.0.1/32 Metric: 10 Type: 1 Up Router Capabilities: Router Id: 10.0.0.1 Flags: [] Area leader priority: 250 algorithm: 0 Level-2 LSP originated by C1 running Arista cEOS c1#show isis database level-2 c1.00-00 detail Legend: H - hostname conflict U - node unreachable IS-IS Instance: Gandalf VRF: default IS-IS Level 2 Link State Database LSPID Seq Num Cksum Life Length IS Received LSPID Flags c1.00-00 30 49359 687 169 L2 0000.0000.0002.00-00 <> LSP generation remaining wait time: 0 ms Time remaining until refresh: 387 s NLPID: 0xCC(IPv4) Hostname: c1 Area addresses: 49.0100 Interface address: 10.1.0.9 Interface address: 10.1.0.13 Interface address: 10.1.0.1 Interface address: 10.0.0.2 IS Neighbor : c2.00 Metric: 10 IS Neighbor : x1.00 Metric: 10 Reachability : 10.1.0.16/30 Metric: 20 Type: 1 Up Reachability : 10.0.0.3/32 Metric: 20 Type: 1 Up Reachability : 10.0.0.1/32 Metric: 20 Type: 1 Up Reachability : 10.1.0.4/30 Metric: 20 Type: 1 Up Reachability : 10.1.0.8/30 Metric: 10 Type: 1 Up Reachability : 10.1.0.12/30 Metric: 10 Type: 1 Up Reachability : 10.1.0.0/30 Metric: 10 Type: 1 Up Reachability : 10.0.0.2/32 Metric: 10 Type: 1 Up Router Capabilities: Router Id: 10.0.0.2 Flags: [] Area leader priority: 250 algorithm: 0 As you can see, C1 inserted the information from R1 L1 LSP into its own L2 LSP. When that information is propagated across the level-2 backbone, other level-2 routers use it in their routing tables.

Let\u2019s trace the paths towards X1 and X2 from R1. This is what Arista EOS has to say 3 : The traceroute command shows suboptimal routing from R1 toward X2 r1#traceroute 10.0.0.4 traceroute to x1 (10.0.0.4), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 1 c1 (10.1.0.1) 0.043 ms 0.008 ms 0.007 ms 2 x1 (10.0.0.4) 1.113 ms 1.132 ms 1.396 ms r1#traceroute 10.0.0.5 traceroute to x2 (10.0.0.5), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 1 c1 (10.1.0.1) 0.040 ms 0.009 ms 0.007 ms 2 c2 (10.1.0.10) 0.635 ms 0.656 ms 0.863 ms 3 x2 (10.0.0.5) 2.034 ms 2.077 ms 2.205 ms Notice the suboptimal path R1 takes to reach X2. Although X2 is directly connected to C2, and C2 can be used as a default gateway, the outgoing traffic flows through C1. Disabling ECMP 4 does not solve the problem. If you do that, R1 will generate just one default route from the LSP database and choose the LSP with the ATT flag set following these rules 5 : The closest (based on the metric) level-1-2 router with the ATT flag set When multiple equidistant level-1-2 routers exist, choose the one with the highest SystemID. Takeaway: Carefully consider using level-1 areas and accept that sub-optimal routing can occur. Consider the practical advice from Configure IS-IS Routing for IPv4 before resorting to level-1 areas. In most cases, performance or scalability is no longer a good reason to deploy multi-level IS-IS networks. Partitioning the Transit Network Finally, let\u2019s see what happens when the level-2 backbone breaks (the official term is partitions ). Before starting, let\u2019s verify that we have connectivity from X1 to X2: Check transit connectivity through the IS-IS area 49.0100 $ netlab connect -q x1 ping 10.0.0.5 PING x2 (10.0.0.5): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 10.0.0.5: seq=0 ttl=62 time=1.427 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.0.5: seq=1 ttl=62 time=1.377 ms .... Next, shut down the link between C1 and C2 (shutting down the Ethernet2 interface on C2 will do the trick). Although there\u2019s the physical path between X1 and X2 (X1\u2192C1\u2192R1\u2192C2\u2192X2), X1 cannot reach X2: X1 cannot reach X2 once the C1-C2 link is shut down $ netlab connect -q x1 ping 10.0.0.5 PING x2 (10.0.0.5): 56 data bytes ping: sendto: Network unreachable Takeaway: The level-2 backbone MUST NOT become partitioned. IS-IS has no mechanism like OSPF virtual links that could stitch together a partitioned level-2 backbone. Before Moving On Congratulations.

The router will only send level-1 ISHs on that interface. You can also configure a router to be a level-1 router and limit an interface to be a level-2 circuit, resulting in no ISHs. \u21a9 Even though ECMP is enabled on Arista cEOS, only the first ECMP entry is inserted into the underlying Linux routing table. All inter-area traffic is thus sent to the first default gateway (C1). Other implementations might spray the probe packets across all potential next hops, resulting in an even more interesting traceroute printout. \u21a9 You can disable ECMP by setting maximum-paths to 1 in the IS-IS process. Some devices expect maximum-paths configured for a routing process, others expect it configured for individual address families. \u21a9 When an IS-IS process uses N-way ECMP, it chooses the top N equidistant level-1-2 routers based on their SystemID. \u21a9","title":"Multilevel IS-IS Deployments"},{"location":"advanced/1-multilevel/#multilevel-is-is-deployments","text":"By Dan Partelly Like OSPF, IS-IS was designed when router memory was measured in megabytes and CPU speeds in MHz.

The routing table accurately reflects the fact that R1 lost visibility of the level-2 network topology. The reduction in the IP routing table size is trivial at the scale of a 5-router lab, but as you can easily imagine, it can be significant in large networks. Since we\u2019re aiming to optimize the R1 routing and not to fragment the network, let\u2019s confirm that we still have reachability to routers in other areas: Inter-area connectivity tests on R1 r1#ping 10.0.0.4 PING 10.0.0.4 (10.0.0.4) 72(100) bytes of data. 80 bytes from 10.0.0.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=0.479 ms 80 bytes from 10.0.0.4: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=0.144 ms .... r1#ping 10.0.0.5 PING 10.0.0.5 (10.0.0.5) 72(100) bytes of data. 80 bytes from 10.0.0.5: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=0.801 ms 80 bytes from 10.0.0.5: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=0.345 ms .... Despite no longer having a route to X1 and X2\u2019s loopbacks, R1 can still reach them. Astute engineers might have already noticed something interesting in the R1 routing table: an ECMP default route pointing towards C1 and C2. This route is used for L2 default routing, and it\u2019s the key to reaching the level-2 backbone and, implicitly, other IS-IS areas.

The full name of this flag is \u201cAttached\u201d, and in the words of ISO_IEC_10589_2002, a level-1-2 router considers itself attached when it can reach at least one other area using the corresponding routeing metric, or It has at least one enabled reachable address prefix with the corresponding metric defined. If a router considers itself attached, it will originate L1 LSPs with the ATT flag set. This has the following effects: The ATT flag signals level-1 routers in the same area that the router advertising it can carry traffic to the level-2 backbone and into other areas. The level-1-2 router advertises itself as an exit point from a level-1 area. Level-1 routers receiving an LSP with the ATT bit set will insert a default route pointing to the router that sent the LSP into their IP routing table. Back to the default routes we saw earlier in R1\u2019s routing table. In our topology, both C1 and C2 consider themselves attached to the level-2 backbone, and they both originate L1 LSPs with the ATT bit set. Router R1 has ECMP enabled by default, so it uses both C1 and C2 as the exit points from the level-1 area and adds two default routes to its IP routing table.","title":"L2 Default Routing Mechanics"},{"location":"advanced/1-multilevel/#distribution-of-l1-routes-into-l2-backbone","text":"We have already checked that R1 can reach routers in other areas (X1 and X2), but there is another part of the puzzle that needs to be explored: how do X1 and X2 know about R1?

Unfortunately, LFA works only in a subset of well-designed network topologies.

If you start the lab with the -s sr=yes parameter, you\u2019ll also get the prerequisite SR-MPLS configuration. Configuration Sequence Configure SR-MPLS on all routers ( more details ) Reduce the IS-IS timers on all interfaces to the minimum your device supports to get faster failure detection 2 . Configure TI-LFA link protection (the network is not big enough for a meaningful node protection ) using an IS-IS router configuration command similar to fast-reroute ti-lfa . Some platforms allow you to configure TI-LFA within the routing protocol configuration, while others require TI-LFA configuration on every interface. Cisco IOS requires both, plus LFA ( isis fast-reroute protection ) configured on all interfaces. Validation It\u2019s tough to see what TI-LFA is doing. Most modern IS-IS implementations flood changes immediately and start SPF within milliseconds 3 . It\u2019s therefore best to inspect what TI-LFA would do with the show commands. For example, the show isis ti-lfa path command on Arista EOS displays the nodes the router would use to get to a specific destination in case of a link failure: TI-LFA paths displayed by Arista EOS r1#show isis ti-lfa path TI-LFA paths for IPv4 address family Topology ID: Level-2 Destination Algorithm Constraint Path ----------------- --------------- ----------------------- ---- r4 SPF exclude Ethernet2 r3 r2 SPF exclude Ethernet2 r4 r3 SPF exclude Ethernet1 r4 In our case, if the Ethernet2 (R1-R2) link fails, R1 would use R3 to reach R4, and R4 to reach R2. Use the show isis ti-lfa path detail command for even more details.

Restarting FRR would kill the container. netlab takes care of that and enables all the daemons necessary to complete the lab exercises. Restarting FRR daemons wipes out the current (running) configuration. If you want to retain it, save it to the startup configuration with the vtysh write command. The write command saves the running configuration (that you can inspect with show running-config ) into the /etc/frr/frr.conf file. However, the show startup-config 5 does not display the content of that file. Exit vtysh and use the more /etc/frr/frr.conf command 6 to inspect it. You could add the required line to the FRRouting daemons file with any text editor 7 or use the following trick: Use sudo bash to start another Linux shell as the root user Use the echo command with output redirection to add a line to the /etc/frr/daemons file. rtr(bash)#sudo bash root@rtr:/# echo 'isis=yes' >>/etc/frr/daemons root@rtr:/# exit After enabling the IS-IS daemon and restarting FRR, you should see the isisd process in the ps -ef printout or the IS-IS daemon mentioned in the sudo systemctl status frr.service printout. Work with the FRRouting CLI FRRouting suite includes a virtual shell ( vtysh ) closely resembling industry-standard CLI 8 . It has to be started from the Linux command line with the vtysh command. The vtysh CLI has to run as the root user unless you change the FRR-related permissions to allow a regular user to use it. The usual command to start the vtysh is thus sudo vtysh (but see also To Sudo Or Not to Sudo ). r2(bash)#sudo vtysh Hello, this is FRRouting (version 9.1_git).

Unfortunately, things are never as simple as they look in the Linux world: When using SSH, you log into Cumulus Linux or FRRouting virtual machines as a regular user (user vagrant in netlab -created labs) and have to use the sudo command to start vtysh . Cumulus Linux and FRR containers run as the root user, and you connect to them as the root user with the docker exec or netlab connect commands 9 . When working with containers, you can start vtysh without using the sudo command. You can execute sudo vtysh as a root user on Cumulus Linux containers but not within an FRR container. The FRR container does not include the sudo command. Long story short: Use sudo vtysh whenever possible to burn it into your muscle memory.

You probably don\u2019t need them as you\u2019ll be running FRR on top of a Unix-like operating system that supports pipes, but it might be a bit convoluted to use vtysh in a pipe. To use the vtysh output in a pipe, you have to execute vtysh and get the results of a show command in a single command: You could use sudo vtysh -c 'show command' when you\u2019re in the bash shell of a lab device, for example: r2(bash)#vtysh -c 'show isis database'|grep r2 r2.00-00 * 81 0x00000001 0xec86 1302 0/0/0 Alternatively, you could use the netlab connect --show command to execute a vtysh show command on a lab device: $ netlab connect r2 -q --show isis database|grep r2 r2.00-00 * 81 0x00000001 0xec86 1286 0/0/0 Tip Use netlab connect --quiet --show to omit the Connecting to... message.

Device Requirements Use any netlab -supported device for the router you\u2019ll be configuring. Use a device supported by the netlab IS-IS configuration module for X1 and X2 (default: FRRouting virtual machines or containers). You can do automated lab validation when using FRRouting on the external routers. Starting the Lab You can start the lab on your own lab infrastructure or in GitHub Codespaces ( more details ): Change directory to basic/1-simple-ipv4 Execute netlab up Log into your device (RTR) with netlab connect rtr and verify that the IP addresses are configured on all its interfaces. You\u2019ll get a lab with IPv4 addresses configured on all interfaces and IS-IS routing configured on X1 and X2 but not RTR. Configuration Tasks The minimal IS-IS configuration process has three or four steps: Start an IS-IS routing process with a global configuration command similar to router isis . You might have to specify a routing process tag \u2013 a string that identifies the IS-IS instance in other configuration commands. Assign a CLNS address (NET \u2013 Network Entity Title) to the IS-IS routing process with a routing configuration command similar to net address ( more details ). The NET assigned to your router is 49.0001.0000.0000.0042.00 Enable IS-IS routing for IPv4 on individual interfaces with an interface configuration command similar to ip router isis tag or isis enable tag . Some devices also want you to configure which address families (IPv4 or IPv6) you want to route with IS-IS. The router configuration command to do that is often address-family ipv4 . Tip If you\u2019re using FRRouting on RTR, you might have to enable the IS-IS daemon first. You\u2019ll find more details in the Configuring IS-IS on FRRouting lab. Unfortunately, most IS-IS implementations are ancient and use defaults that might have made sense decades ago. You should also configure the following parameters 1 : Configure the links with two nodes attached to them as point-to-point links with an interface configuration command similar to isis network point-to-point (more details in IS-IS on Point-to-Point Links ) Configure your router to be a Level-2-Only router with the router configuration command similar to is-type level-2-only 2 (more details in Optimize Simple IS-IS Deployments ). On some devices, you\u2019ll have to configure wide metrics with a router configuration command similar to metric-style wide 4 (more details in Using IS-IS Metrics ). Finally, you might have to configure the standard point-to-point three-way handshake on Cisco IOSv 3 . The interface configuration command to do that is \u200cisis three-way-handshake ietf . Finally, make sure your configuration includes these settings: Logging of adjacency changes (typically configured with a router configuration command like log-adjacency-changes ) Dynamic mapping of NETs to hostnames (usually enabled; sometimes you can\u2019t turn it off) Validation You can use the netlab validate command if you\u2019re using netlab release 1.8.4 or later and run FRRouting on the external routers. This is the printout you should get after completing the lab exercise: You should also do basic manual validation on your device: Inspect IS-IS adjacencies with a command similar to show isis neighbors or show isis adjacency .

That lab uses the same topology and device configurations, so you can keep going without restarting the lab. Background Information IS-IS was designed to be the routing protocol for the ISO/OSI protocol stack. Its name is derived from ISO terminology: IS stands for Intermediate System (the device also known as router , gateway or layer-3 switch ). Thus, IS-IS is the protocol that runs between Intermediate Systems (in other words, the router-to-router protocol). While ISO designed IS-IS to be used with CLNP, its data structures (everything is CLV 6 -based) made it easy to extend, and so IETF quickly specified how to use IS-IS for IPv4 and (later) IPv6 routing. IS-IS does not run on top of another layer-3 protocol like OSPF or BGP run on top of IP; it is an independent protocol at layer-3 and uses a dedicated 802.1 SAP ( more details ). You cannot use the standard IP access control mechanisms with IS-IS; on the other hand, it\u2019s impossible to spoof IS-IS messages if the intruder does not have access to the underlying layer-2 infrastructure. IS-IS addressing follows the OSI addressing principles. Network addresses (Network Service Access Points \u2013 NSAPs) are assigned to nodes , not interfaces . OSI protocol suite used variable-length addresses, and according to the ( poorly formatted copy of ) IS-IS specifications, the NET is split into three parts (you\u2019ll find more details in RFC 1237 ): +--------+-----------+----+ | Area | System-ID | NS | +--------+-----------+----+ The NSAP Selector (the last byte) specifies the software entity on the node that should receive the packet (similar to the TCP/UDP/OSPF protocol type within the IPv4 header). IS-IS uses NSAP selector value zero and calls the resulting address Network Entity Title (NET). Thus, the last byte of NET always has to be zero. The System ID (node address within an area, similar to the subnet part of an IP address) is one to eight bytes long. Subsequent parts of IS-IS specification assume a 6-byte System ID (12 hexadecimal characters), and that\u2019s what all implementations use. The Area is whatever is left on the left-hand side of the NET after you take away the rightmost seven bytes. The NET is usually formatted as a hexadecimal string (two hexadecimal digits per byte) with two-byte portions (four hexadecimal digits) separated by a dot. The placement of dots is a bit counterintuitive: The rightmost dot has to be between the System ID and NSAP Selector. Subsequent dots have to be four characters left of the previous dot, resulting in two dots within the System ID and a dot between the node System ID and the IS-IS area. For example, the NET we used in this lab ( 49000100000000004200 )has to be written as 49.0001.0000.0000.0042.00 . The area address could have any length 7 as long as it\u2019s specified as a whole number of bytes (an even number of digits). IS-IS doesn\u2019t care about the contents of the area address. If two routers have the value in that part of the NET, they belong to the same area; if not, they don\u2019t. Finally, other ISO standards define the meaning of the leftmost part of a network address (NSAP). The first (leftmost) byte is the Authority and Format Identifier (AFI), and the value 49 indicates private address space (similar to RFC 1918 IPv4 address space) (see RFC 1629 for more details). Using two bytes as the area ID usually makes sense, and that\u2019s why most NETs you find in online examples start with 49.0001 ;) 8 Reference Information Lab Wiring Origin Device Origin Port Destination Device Destination Port rtr Ethernet1 x1 eth1 rtr Ethernet2 x2 eth1 Note: The interface names depend on the devices you use in the lab.

The most significant bits of information include: NET , which can be split into area and system ID . Some devices display NET; others display the IS-IS area and the system ID as independent components. The address families (CLNP/NSAPs, IPv4, IPv6, IP multicast) Router type: intra-area router (level-1), inter-area router (level-2) or multi-level router 2 (level-1-2, sometimes shown as level-3 because 1+2=3). Try to find the above information in the printout produced by FRRouting and Arista cEOS: Basic IS-IS information displayed by FRRouting $ netlab connect rtr --show isis summary vrf : default Process Id : 32 System Id : 0000.0000.0001 Up time : 00:00:15 ago Number of areas : 1 Area Gandalf: Net: 49.0001.0000.0000.0001.00 TX counters per PDU type: L2 IIH: 2 P2P IIH: 14 L2 LSP: 8 L2 CSNP: 4 L2 PSNP: 4 LSP RXMT: 0 RX counters per PDU type: P2P IIH: 14 L2 LSP: 4 L2 CSNP: 4 L2 PSNP: 4 Drop counters per PDU type: Advertise high metrics: Disabled Level-2: LSP0 regenerated: 2 LSPs purged: 0 SPF: minimum interval : 1 IPv4 route computation: last run elapsed : 00:00:13 ago last run duration : 152 usec run count : 2 Basic IS-IS information displayed by Arista cEOS rtr>show isis summary IS-IS Instance: Gandalf VRF: default Instance ID: 0 System ID: 0000.0000.0001, administratively enabled Router ID: IPv4: 10.0.0.1 Hostname: rtr Multi Topology disabled, not attached IPv4 Preference: Level 1: 115, Level 2: 115 IPv6 Preference: Level 1: 115, Level 2: 115 IS-Type: Level 2, Number active interfaces: 3 Routes IPv4 only LSP size maximum: Level 1: 1492, Level 2: 1492 Interval Type Max Wait Initial Wait Hold Interval ----------------------- -------- ------------ ------------- LSP generation interval 5 s 50 ms 50 ms SPF interval 2000 ms 1000 ms 1000 ms Current SPF hold interval(ms): Level 1: 0, Level 2: 2000 Last Level 2 SPF run 7 seconds ago CSNP generation interval: 10 seconds Dynamic Flooding: Disabled Authentication mode: Level 1: None, Level 2: None Graceful Restart: Disabled, Graceful Restart Helper: Enabled Area addresses: 49.0001 level 2: number DIS interfaces: 0, LSDB size: 3 Area Leader: None Overload Bit is not set. Redistributed Level 1 routes: 0 limit: Not Configured Redistributed Level 2 routes: 0 limit: Not Configured Explore IS-IS Adjacencies IS-IS high-level principles are similar to OSPF ones: A hello protocol is used to discover neighbors. Unlike OSPF, which uses IP as a layer-3 protocol, IS-IS uses its own layer-3 protocol (IS-IS hello packets are encapsulated directly into layer-2 frames; more details ). Once the neighbors are discovered, an adjacency is established with them. Neighbors exchange the description (table-of-contents) of their LSP database 3 and, based on the results of that exchange, any missing LSPs. Examining IS-IS neighbors is thus the next logical step after examining the local IS-IS parameters; the command to use is often show isis neighbor (or show isis adjacency ). You should be looking for the following information: The local interface Neighbor name or system ID. Most modern IS-IS implementations display neighbor names 4 . The state of adjacency (it should be Up , but could also be Down or Init ) The type of adjacency: intra-area adjacency (level-1), inter-area adjacency (level-2) or multi-level adjacency (level-1-2) 5 . Remote MAC address (SNPA 6 ). The remote MAC address is sometimes displayed as 2020.2020.2020 on point-to-point links. Tip All routers in your lab are configured as level-2 routers and should have only level-2 adjacencies. Another useful command when checking IS-IS adjacencies is show isis interface Try to extract the above information from the printouts generated by FRRouting and Arista cEOS: IS-IS neighbors displayed by FRRouting $ netlab connect rtr --show isis neighbor Area Gandalf: System Id Interface L State Holdtime SNPA x1 eth1 2 Up 29 2020.2020.2020 x2 eth2 2 Up 29 2020.2020.2020 IS-IS neighbors displayed by Arista cEOS rtr>show isis neighbors Instance VRF System Id Type Interface SNPA State Hold time Circuit Id Gandalf default x1 L2 Ethernet1 P2P UP 29 00 Gandalf default x2 L2 Ethernet2 P2P UP 29 00 Sometimes, you have to dig deeper and display neighbor details; a typical command to display those details is show isis neighbor detail .

LSPDB is not a true database; it\u2019s a distributed eventually-consistent 9 key-value store 10 shared among all routers in an area or among all inter-area routers. Unlike OSPF, where an ABR could have topology information for multiple areas, IS-IS uses a simpler two-level approach: Routers participating in intra-area routing (level-1 and level-1-2 routers) share a level-1 link-state database containing intra-area topology and prefixes. Level-1-2 and level-2 routers (inter-area routers) share a level-2 link-state database containing inter-area topology and prefixes from all IS-IS areas. Tip All routers in your lab are configured as level-2 routers and thus share only the level-2 LSPDB 11 . OSPF stores various bits of topology information in multiple types of Link State Advertisements (LSA). IS-IS stores all information generated by a single router in a single Link State PDU 12 (LSP) unless it has too much information for a single LSP, in which case it generates multiple LSP fragments ( more details ). Tip IS-IS cannot fragment LSPs in transit; the maximum LSP size must never exceed the lowest MTU of any link in the IS-IS network. IS-IS contains no mechanism to detect the minimum network-wide MTU dynamically; you have to set the maximum LSP size with a router configuration command similar to lsp-mtu . The identifier of an IS-IS LSP (LSP ID) is always in the format systemid.nodeid-fragmentid : The systemid is the 6-octet System ID part of NET . While IS-IS internally uses the 6-octet value, most implementations display hostnames in the show commands. You can often use a command like show isis hostname to display the name-to-system-ID mappings. The nodeid is zero for an LSP describing the router\u2019s information and non-zero for LAN pseudonodes 13 . The fragmentid is the sequence number of the LSP fragment . You can inspect the IS-IS topology database with a command similar to show isis database . The short printout usually lists the LSPs (their LSP ID), the LSP length, their sequence number, and their remaining lifetime. Tip A quickly increasing LSP sequence number might indicate routing instabilities.

Each IS-IS LSP contains numerous data items encoded as Type-Length-Value (TLV) triplets. The TLV values are usually displayed in a human-friendly format; you\u2019d have to use a packet capture tool like tcpdump or wireshark to see the dirty details. The recognized IS-IS data types are collected in the IANA IS-IS TLV Codepoints registry; you\u2019d usually see the following TLVs in a modern IPv4 network: TLV Description 1 Area address 137 Hostname 242 Router capabilities 129 Supported protocols (IPv4/IPv6) 22 Extended IS Reachability 15 The information about an adjacent router and the cost to reach it 132 IPv4 Interface Address 135 IPv4 Extended Reachability The cost of a connected prefix This is how FRRouting and Arista cEOS display the LSP information: LSP content displayed by FRRouting $ netlab connect rtr --show isis database detail rtr.00-00 Connecting to container clab-explore-rtr, executing vtysh -c \"show isis database detail rtr.00-00\" Area Gandalf: IS-IS Level-2 link-state database: LSP ID PduLen SeqNumber Chksum Holdtime ATT/P/OL rtr.00-00 * 113 0x00000002 0x902e 1589 0/0/0 Protocols Supported: IPv4 Area Address: 49.0001 Hostname: rtr TE Router ID: 10.0.0.1 Router Capability: 10.0.0.1 , D:0, S:0 Extended Reachability: 0000.0000.0002.00 (Metric: 10) Extended Reachability: 0000.0000.0003.00 (Metric: 10) IPv4 Interface Address: 10.0.0.1 Extended IP Reachability: 10.0.0.1/32 (Metric: 10) Extended IP Reachability: 10.1.0.0/30 (Metric: 10) Extended IP Reachability: 10.1.0.4/30 (Metric: 10) LSP content displayed by Arista EOS rtr>show isis database rtr.00-00 detail Legend: H - hostname conflict U - node unreachable IS-IS Instance: Gandalf VRF: default IS-IS Level 2 Link State Database LSPID Seq Num Cksum Life Length IS Received LSPID Flags rtr.00-00 2 26795 1001 119 L2 0000.0000.0001.00-00 <> LSP generation remaining wait time: 0 ms Time remaining until refresh: 701 s NLPID: 0xCC(IPv4) Hostname: rtr Area addresses: 49.0001 Interface address: 10.1.0.5 Interface address: 10.1.0.1 Interface address: 10.0.0.1 IS Neighbor : x1.00 Metric: 10 IS Neighbor : x2.00 Metric: 10 Reachability : 10.1.0.4/30 Metric: 10 Type: 1 Up Reachability : 10.1.0.0/30 Metric: 10 Type: 1 Up Reachability : 10.0.0.1/32 Metric: 10 Type: 1 Up Router Capabilities: Router Id: 10.0.0.1 Flags: [] Area leader priority: 250 algorithm: 0 The Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm uses the information from the LSPDB to build a shortest-path (lowest-cost) tree spanning the network topology: The LSPs are nodes in the topology graph The \u200cExtended IS Reachability TLVs describe the unidirectional connectivity between nodes. The SPF algorithm has to do a two-way connectivity check (TWCC) 16 to verify two nodes can communicate. Links that don\u2019t pass the TWCC are not considered when building the shortest-path tree. After the SPF algorithm generates the spanning tree, it uses the minimum cost toward each node together with the Extended IP Reachability TLVs advertised by those nodes to find the minimum cost (and the optimum node/path/next hop) toward every prefix advertised by other routers. LSP Fragments You rarely see LSP fragments in small networks, but it\u2019s pretty easy to generate them by lowering the maximum LSP size. For example, if we reduce the LSP size on rtr to 256 17 , we\u2019ll get two fragments: LSP fragments describing the rtr state rtr# show isis database Area Gandalf: IS-IS Level-2 link-state database: LSP ID PduLen SeqNumber Chksum Holdtime ATT/P/OL rtr.00-00 * 67 0x00000024 0xe3a6 1648 0/0/0 rtr.00-01 * 75 0x00000006 0xa54b 1648 0/0/0 x1.00-00 92 0x00000017 0xf8b5 1288 0/0/0 x2.00-00 92 0x00000018 0x9c07 1043 0/0/0 The LSP fragments contain the same information as the original LSP, only split across multiple smaller database objects: The detailed view of the LSP fragments rtr# show isis database detail rtr.00-00 Area Gandalf: IS-IS Level-2 link-state database: LSP ID PduLen SeqNumber Chksum Holdtime ATT/P/OL rtr.00-00 * 67 0x00000024 0xe3a6 1590 0/0/0 Protocols Supported: IPv4 Area Address: 49.0001 Hostname: rtr TE Router ID: 10.0.0.1 Router Capability: 10.0.0.1 , D:0, S:0 Extended Reachability: 0000.0000.0002.00 (Metric: 10) rtr# show isis database detail rtr.00-01 Area Gandalf: IS-IS Level-2 link-state database: LSP ID PduLen SeqNumber Chksum Holdtime ATT/P/OL rtr.00-01 * 75 0x00000006 0xa54b 1589 0/0/0 Extended Reachability: 0000.0000.0003.00 (Metric: 10) IPv4 Interface Address: 10.0.0.1 Extended IP Reachability: 10.0.0.1/32 (Metric: 10) Extended IP Reachability: 10.1.0.0/30 (Metric: 10) Extended IP Reachability: 10.1.0.4/30 (Metric: 10) Next: IS-IS on Point-to-Point Links Reference Information Lab Wiring Origin Device Origin Port Destination Device Destination Port rtr Ethernet1 x1 eth1 rtr Ethernet2 x2 eth1 Note: The interface names depend on the devices you use in the lab.

We got that far; let\u2019s see why point-to-point IS-IS links are strongly preferred on point-to-point Ethernet interfaces. We\u2019ll use the simplest possible lab topology to keep things simple: two routers connected with a single link. Device Requirements Use any device supported by the netlab IS-IS configuration module . Starting the Lab You can start the lab on your own lab infrastructure or in GitHub Codespaces ( more details ): Change directory to basic/3-p2p Execute netlab up Log into lab devices with netlab connect You\u2019ll get a lab with IPv4 addresses and minimal IS-IS configurations on all devices. Point-to-Point and Multi-Access Links Like OSPF, IS-IS supports point-to-point (P2P) and multi-access links. Point-to-point links were traditionally used on P2P WAN links; all other media types (LAN, but also multi-access WAN like Frame Relay) used multi-access links. That\u2019s still the default behavior you get on most platforms. Multi-access links have several drawbacks when compared to point-to-point links: The routers on a multi-access link must elect 1 a Designated Intermediate System 2 , prolonging the adjacency establishment process 3 . Unlike OSPF, there is no Backup DIS in IS-IS; routers connected to a multi-access link elect a new DIS when the current one is gone 4 . The IS-IS LSP database contains extra objects. Instead of point-to-point links between the routers, the LSPDB contains pseudonode LSPs (originated by DIS 5 ) describing LAN links 6 . For example, our simple topology would result in the following LSPDB objects 7 : The LSP database with a pseudonode LSP \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502r1.00-00\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524r2.8e-00\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524r2.00-00\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 Recovery from transmission errors takes longer on LAN links. There are no retransmissions in IS-IS; routers realize there\u2019s a problem when the DIS sends a list of its LSPDB contents (CSNP packets), usually every 10 seconds. On the other hand, using pseudonode LSPs on true multi-access links makes perfect sense. They reduce the number of links in the topology graph 8 , resulting in faster SPF runs. Exploring Multi-Access Database Structures It\u2019s time to get our hands dirty. Log into one of the lab devices and examine its IS-IS database. You should get a printout similar to this one. Please note an extra LSP (the description of the LAN subnet generated by R2): The LSP database with a pseudonode LSP r1# show isis database Area Gandalf: IS-IS Level-2 link-state database: LSP ID PduLen SeqNumber Chksum Holdtime ATT/P/OL r1.00-00 * 92 0x00000005 0xc392 1164 0/0/0 r2.00-00 92 0x00000005 0x60ef 1167 0/0/0 r2.74-00 51 0x00000003 0x5202 1239 0/0/0 Let\u2019s inspect the extra LSP. It looks very similar to an OSPF type-2 LSA: It describes links from the LAN segment to individual routers. Unlike OSPF type-2 LSA, it does not contain the LAN prefix.

Protocol-specific prefixes are advertised as part of the router LSP. Not surprisingly, the routers connected to the LAN segment advertise their links to the LAN segment and the LAN IPv4 prefix.

That\u2019s enough to find the optimum paths to all prefixes in the network 9 Using Point-to-Point Links Core Ethernet links in modern networks are usually point-to-point links 10 between routers 11 . Modeling those links as multi-access networks makes no sense, yet most IS-IS implementations use that approach on all LAN interfaces. Use an interface configuration command similar to isis network point-to-point to tell IS-IS to treat an interface like a point-to-point link. Do that on both routers in your network. Tip While changing the interface type, you might observe logging/error messages similar to p2p hello on non p2p circuit or lan hello on non broadcast circuit 12 . Warning If you use Cisco IOSv on one of the routers and some other network operating system on the other router, you SHOULD configure \u200cisis three-way-handshake ietf on Cisco IOSv interfaces ( more details ) because someone thought it prudent to keep the pre-standard protocol as the default setting for at least a decade after the RFC was published. Cisco IOS XE uses the IETF 3-way handshake as the default protocol. Let\u2019s inspect the IS-IS topology database after the change. As expected, it contains two LSPs (one per router).

If you manage to inspect its details before it disappears, you\u2019ll notice it no longer claims to have connections to R1 and R2. The network LSP should be removed (aged out) from the LSP databases in a few seconds; it might persist longer in the LSP database of the router originating it 13 . The LSPs describe the direct connection between the routers. For example, R1 claims it\u2019s directly connected to R2 14 : The router LSP with a point-to-point link to another router r1# show isis database detail r1.00-00 Area Gandalf: IS-IS Level-2 link-state database: LSP ID PduLen SeqNumber Chksum Holdtime ATT/P/OL r1.00-00 * 92 0x00000008 0x5d6a 1533 0/0/0 Protocols Supported: IPv4 Area Address: 49.0001 Hostname: r1 TE Router ID: 10.0.0.1 Router Capability: 10.0.0.1 , D:0, S:0 Extended Reachability: 0000.0000.0002.00 (Metric: 10) IPv4 Interface Address: 10.0.0.1 Extended IP Reachability: 10.0.0.1/32 (Metric: 10) Extended IP Reachability: 10.1.0.0/30 (Metric: 10) Next: Using IS-IS Metrics Optimize Simple IS-IS Deployments Three-Way Handshake The original IS-IS specifications used a simple HELLO protocol on point-to-point links 15 : whenever a router received an IS-IS Hello (IIH) from an adjacent router, it assumed the adjacent router could be reached, resulting in miserable failures on unidirectional links 16 . That hurdle was removed with the three-way handshake defined in RFC 5303 . That RFC specifies a new IS-IS option (Point-to-Point Three-Way Adjacency) that contains the System ID of the adjacent device, allowing IS-IS routers to verify they have a two-way communication. Modern IS-IS implementations use the three-way handshake by default. Still, you might have to turn it off to interoperate with an older device (or a device with ancient defaults) with an interface command similar to no isis three-way-handshake 17 . Warning A mismatch in the three-way handshake setting could have bizarre results. For example, turning it off on an FRRouting device results in one of the neighbors having a fully operational IS-IS adjacency while, at the same time, the other neighbor claims it can see no neighbors. To make matters worse, that often happens only after the IS-IS adjacency has been lost and would have to be re-established. As the last task in this lab, try out how your devices react to a three-way handshake mismatch (assuming you can configure it): Turn it off on one of the routers. Clear the IS-IS adjacency with a command similar to clear isis neighbor Enjoy the confusing logging messages.

OSPF would call DIS a DR. \u21a9 And consequently, the overall convergence time after a link recovery. \u21a9 DIS does not have the critical role OSPF DR has. DIS is not responsible for flooding LSP changes; its only role is to help detect transmission errors by periodically sending a table-of-contents (CSNP) of its LSPDB. \u21a9 Remember the nodeid octet in the LSP ID? That octet uniquely identifies a pseudonode originated by a DIS. The systemid in a pseudonode LSP is identical to the DIS systemid , making it very simple to identify the DIS. \u21a9 The pseudonode LSP is very similar to OSPF type-2 LSA. \u21a9 The LSP ID of the LAN pseudonode depends on the implementation \u21a9 A star topology with the pseudonode LSP in the middle as opposed to a full mesh topology \u21a9 The proof is left as an exercise for the reader. \u21a9 A major exception: routers connected to a Carrier Ethernet E-LAN service. \u21a9 The devices also known as layer-3 switches in marketing collaterals. \u21a9 On many network devices, you must enable message logging on terminal sessions with a command similar to terminal monitor . \u21a9 That\u2019s the price for using an eventually-consistent distributed database. Deleting records from such a database and ensuring they\u2019re not recreated from disconnected stale copies is a non-trivial task. \u21a9 FRR printouts are a bit inconsistent. Router names are displayed in high-level printouts, while the detailed printouts contain system IDs. Use the show isis hostname command to display the mapping between system IDs and hostnames. \u21a9 Similar to OSPF, IS-IS hello packets on multi-access media always had a field specifying IS-IS neighbors that a router can see. For whatever reason, that field was not present in the original specification of IS-IS hello packets used on point-to-point links. \u21a9 See the introduction section of RFC 5303 for more details. \u21a9 RFC 5303 was published in 2008, and recent IS-IS implementations, for example, Arista EOS, no longer have that nerd knob. \u21a9","title":"IS-IS on Point-to-Point Links"},{"location":"basic/3-p2p/#is-is-on-point-to-point-links","text":"In the Configure IS-IS Routing for IPv4 lab exercise, I told you to configure the links as point-to-point links and promised a detailed explanation in a follow-up lab exercise.

That hurdle was removed with the three-way handshake defined in RFC 5303 . That RFC specifies a new IS-IS option (Point-to-Point Three-Way Adjacency) that contains the System ID of the adjacent device, allowing IS-IS routers to verify they have a two-way communication. Modern IS-IS implementations use the three-way handshake by default. Still, you might have to turn it off to interoperate with an older device (or a device with ancient defaults) with an interface command similar to no isis three-way-handshake 17 . Warning A mismatch in the three-way handshake setting could have bizarre results. For example, turning it off on an FRRouting device results in one of the neighbors having a fully operational IS-IS adjacency while, at the same time, the other neighbor claims it can see no neighbors. To make matters worse, that often happens only after the IS-IS adjacency has been lost and would have to be re-established. As the last task in this lab, try out how your devices react to a three-way handshake mismatch (assuming you can configure it): Turn it off on one of the routers.

Here\u2019s the full story: Original IS-IS specifications had 6-bit interface metrics (0-63) 3 , and the end-to-end path cost could not exceed 1023 4 . Today, we call those metrics narrow metrics. When large ISPs started using IS-IS, they quickly discovered that those limits were ridiculous. RFC 3784 defined 24-bit metrics (we call them wide metrics), which is what most deployments use today. All existing IS-IS networks that wanted to use the wide metrics had to transition from narrow to wide metrics, usually while keeping the network operational. The solution was to advertise both sets of metrics (that have to match) until all network devices advertise wide metrics. Some vendors call that approach transition metrics. Transitioning from narrow to wide metrics is somewhat convoluted: You must configure all devices to advertise narrow and wide metrics (change the metric style from narrow to transitional ). Once all devices advertise wide metrics, you can configure them to use them (this step might be optional in the IS-IS implementation you\u2019re using). Finally, you can stop advertising the narrow metrics (change the metric style from transitional to wide ). You can start using large metric values only after your devices use only wide metrics. As you can see, starting your IS-IS deployment with wide metrics is much better, especially if you want to use modern IS-IS features like SR-MPLS that work only with wide metrics. Warning You\u2019ll get weird results if some devices in your network support only narrow metrics while others advertise only wide metrics. If you have devices that do not understand the wide metrics, keep using the narrow metrics; otherwise, ensure all devices use only wide metrics. I haven\u2019t seen an IS-IS implementation that doesn\u2019t understand the narrow metrics, and all recent implementations support wide metrics (they\u2019ve been around for 20 years) 5 . Sadly, many devices still use narrow metrics as the default, so let\u2019s reproduce that ancient world in a modern implementation (FRRouting). We\u2019ll use the metric-style router configuration command, set it to narrow on R1, and see what happens to the R1 LSP.

Here\u2019s the full story: Original IS-IS specifications had 6-bit interface metrics (0-63) 3 , and the end-to-end path cost could not exceed 1023 4 . Today, we call those metrics narrow metrics. When large ISPs started using IS-IS, they quickly discovered that those limits were ridiculous. RFC 3784 defined 24-bit metrics (we call them wide metrics), which is what most deployments use today. All existing IS-IS networks that wanted to use the wide metrics had to transition from narrow to wide metrics, usually while keeping the network operational. The solution was to advertise both sets of metrics (that have to match) until all network devices advertise wide metrics. Some vendors call that approach transition metrics. Transitioning from narrow to wide metrics is somewhat convoluted: You must configure all devices to advertise narrow and wide metrics (change the metric style from narrow to transitional ). Once all devices advertise wide metrics, you can configure them to use them (this step might be optional in the IS-IS implementation you\u2019re using). Finally, you can stop advertising the narrow metrics (change the metric style from transitional to wide ). You can start using large metric values only after your devices use only wide metrics. As you can see, starting your IS-IS deployment with wide metrics is much better, especially if you want to use modern IS-IS features like SR-MPLS that work only with wide metrics. Warning You\u2019ll get weird results if some devices in your network support only narrow metrics while others advertise only wide metrics. If you have devices that do not understand the wide metrics, keep using the narrow metrics; otherwise, ensure all devices use only wide metrics. I haven\u2019t seen an IS-IS implementation that doesn\u2019t understand the narrow metrics, and all recent implementations support wide metrics (they\u2019ve been around for 20 years) 5 . Sadly, many devices still use narrow metrics as the default, so let\u2019s reproduce that ancient world in a modern implementation (FRRouting). We\u2019ll use the metric-style router configuration command, set it to narrow on R1, and see what happens to the R1 LSP.

It also wouldn\u2019t allow you to increase the metric on the R1-R3 link above 63. Finally, let\u2019s set the metric style to transition and observe the changes in R1 LSP.

Some devices (for example, FRRouting) expect you to do it on individual interfaces (including the loopback interfaces) with a command similar to ipv6 router isis ; other devices (for example, Arista EOS) require you to configure the IPv6 address family within the IS-IS routing process without changing the interface configuration ( address-family ipv6 is a typical command to use) 1 . Depending on which devices you use in your lab, configure IPv6 IS-IS routing on all links with IPv6 addresses or IPv6 address family in the IS-IS routing process on all routers. The Confusing Results If you\u2019re using Arista EOS in your lab, you\u2019ll notice that R2 no longer wants to have R3 as its IS-IS neighbor.

Multi-Topology Routing The solution to the above conundrum is to use multiple network topologies within a single IS-IS process (multi-topology IS-IS routing, defined in RFC 5120 ), effectively turning IS-IS into a combination of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. Tip Multi-topology IS-IS is still better than a combination of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. You\u2019re using a single routing protocol with a single adjacency/flooding mechanism and a unified data structure, whereas OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 have significant differences. Most IS-IS implementations do not use multi-topology routing by default. You have to enable it with a router configuration command similar to multi-topology (usually within the IPv6 address family) or with a topology ipv6-unicast router configuration command. Do that on all three lab devices. Validation After configuring multi-topology IS-IS routing on all routers in your lab, you should have: IS-IS adjacencies between R2 and R1/R3 Routes for all three IPv4 loopback addresses in the IPv4 routing tables of all routes Routes for IPv6 loopback prefixes on R1 and R2, but not on R3. R3 cannot participate in the IPv6 topology as it has no IPv6-enabled links with other routers.

It\u2019s time to open that can of worms. To keep things simple, we\u2019ll use a simple lab topology: three routers connected into a triangle.

Level-1 and Level-2 Routing in IS-IS The link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF) were designed to run on devices that were two orders of magnitude 1 slower than what we have today 2 and had three orders of magnitude less memory 3 . The routing protocol designers were rightfully worried about scalability challenges and implemented features that would allow them to build large networks: OSPF uses areas connected via a backbone area. IS-IS uses areas (level-1 routing) connected via an overlay inter-area routing topology (level-2 routing). Tip In a follow-up lab exercise, we\u2019ll discuss the details of multi-level routing. Today, we\u2019ll focus on the implications of using single-area level-1 and level-2 routing on the same devices. The IS-IS multi-level routing rules are simple: An area is a contiguous set of routers with NETs that differ only in system IDs (everything left of the system ID is the same) 4 . Level-1 (intra-area) routers know the topology of their area but not what\u2019s in other areas. Level-2 (inter-area) routers know the inter-area topology but not the details of individual areas. Level-1-2 routers are like OSPF Area Border Routers. They know the topology of their area 5 and the inter-area topology. They also summarize intra-area reachability information (prefixes and costs) and advertise them into the inter-area topology (similar to what OSPF ABRs do). Contrary to OSPF (where an interface belongs to a single area), IS-IS routers could establish level-1 and level-2 adjacencies over the same interface. Level-1 routing and level-2 routing are entirely separate. While they use a shared adjacency 6 , they use different topology databases. Every router in an IS-IS network can be a level-1 router , a level-2 router , or a level-1-2 router . Furthermore, you could limit the adjacencies a router forms over individual interfaces (we\u2019ll leave this topic for another day). Now for the sad part: the default router type in most implementations is a level-1-2 router. Let\u2019s assume we have a reasonably small network 7 and don\u2019t use areas (all routers are in the same area). Could the default setting hurt us? Best Scenario: Duplicate Information FRRouting is one of those implementations where running level-1 and level-2 routing in parallel causes only minor damage because it\u2019s IS-IS implementation is incomplete (as of October 2024) and cannot distribute intra-area (level-1) information into inter-area (level-2) LSPs or vice versa 8 as required by the IS-IS standards. Regardless, it\u2019s worth exploring this behavior, as other devices might have similar defaults 9 .

More importantly 11 , every change in the network triggers two SPF 10 runs (one for level-1 topology, one for level-2 topology) with identical results (because every router advertises every prefix in level-1 and level-2 topologies). One of those results is thrown away; within an area, level-1 information takes precedence over level-2 information 12 . Worst Case: Exploding Information Most IS-IS implementations follow the rules from RFC 1195 : Level 2 routers include in their level 2 LSPs a complete list of [IP address, subnet mask, metric] specifying all IP addresses reachable in their area 13 . Now, imagine you\u2019re using an implementation that follows the RFC1195 rules in a single-area network where every router runs level-1 and level-2 routing. Every router advertises every reachable intra-area IP prefix in its level-2 LSP, resulting in humongous level-2 LSPs 14 . All those level-2 prefixes would needlessly increase the overhead of level-2 SPFs (and the results of the level-2 SPF would be ignored anyway). Even worse, every change in the network topology that would change the cost of at least one prefix would result in changed level-2 LSPs that would be flooded across the whole network, triggering even more level-2 SPF runs. Takeaway: In a single-area IS-IS network, never configure your routers as level-1-2 routers. Use level-1 routing or level-2 routing, but not both. You can reproduce that behavior with most IS-IS implementations. Start the lab and explore the contents of a level-1 LSP and corresponding level-2 LSP.

The routing protocol designers were rightfully worried about scalability challenges and implemented features that would allow them to build large networks: OSPF uses areas connected via a backbone area. IS-IS uses areas (level-1 routing) connected via an overlay inter-area routing topology (level-2 routing). Tip In a follow-up lab exercise, we\u2019ll discuss the details of multi-level routing. Today, we\u2019ll focus on the implications of using single-area level-1 and level-2 routing on the same devices. The IS-IS multi-level routing rules are simple: An area is a contiguous set of routers with NETs that differ only in system IDs (everything left of the system ID is the same) 4 . Level-1 (intra-area) routers know the topology of their area but not what\u2019s in other areas. Level-2 (inter-area) routers know the inter-area topology but not the details of individual areas. Level-1-2 routers are like OSPF Area Border Routers. They know the topology of their area 5 and the inter-area topology. They also summarize intra-area reachability information (prefixes and costs) and advertise them into the inter-area topology (similar to what OSPF ABRs do). Contrary to OSPF (where an interface belongs to a single area), IS-IS routers could establish level-1 and level-2 adjacencies over the same interface. Level-1 routing and level-2 routing are entirely separate. While they use a shared adjacency 6 , they use different topology databases. Every router in an IS-IS network can be a level-1 router , a level-2 router , or a level-1-2 router . Furthermore, you could limit the adjacencies a router forms over individual interfaces (we\u2019ll leave this topic for another day). Now for the sad part: the default router type in most implementations is a level-1-2 router. Let\u2019s assume we have a reasonably small network 7 and don\u2019t use areas (all routers are in the same area). Could the default setting hurt us?","title":"Level-1 and Level-2 Routing in IS-IS"},{"location":"basic/6-level-2/#best-scenario-duplicate-information","text":"FRRouting is one of those implementations where running level-1 and level-2 routing in parallel causes only minor damage because it\u2019s IS-IS implementation is incomplete (as of October 2024) and cannot distribute intra-area (level-1) information into inter-area (level-2) LSPs or vice versa 8 as required by the IS-IS standards.

Most everyone agrees that (assuming you\u2019re using a decent implementation) it\u2019s OK to run a few hundred routers (I\u2019ve also heard \u201cless than a thousand routers\u201d) in a relatively stable IS-IS area (TLDR: It Depends\u2122\ufe0f) \u21a9 Let\u2019s be polite: I would not invest my time in figuring out how to use FRRouting as a level-1-2 router in a network that uses multi-level IS-IS routing. \u21a9 Cisco Nexus OS does not distribute level-1 information into level-2 LSPs unless you configure distribute level-1 into level-2 within an IS-IS router address family. \u21a9 Shortest-Path First ; the algorithm used to find the lowest-cost paths in a weighted graph \u21a9 In the world of cheap RAM \u21a9 See section 3.2 of RFC 5302 for more details. \u21a9 RFC 5302 provides a slightly stricter interpretation in section 3.3 : a L1L2 router SHOULD only advertise in their L2 LSP those L1 routes that they use for forwarding themselves. They SHOULD NOT unconditionally advertise into L2 all prefixes from LSPs in the L1 database. \u21a9 OSPF would do the same thing if you configured virtual backbone links across a single-area OSPF network \u21a9 In a network with multiple areas using multi-level IS-IS routing, you might have to run level-1 routing and level-2 routing on some core links (but you wouldn\u2019t do that on each link). \u21a9","title":"Lab Addressing"},{"location":"basic/7-unnumbered/","text":"Running IS-IS Over Unnumbered/LLA-only Interfaces IS-IS does not use IPv4 or IPv6 to exchange routing information.

Running IS-IS over point-to-point or multi-access unnumbered interfaces should be a no-brainer, but do all IS-IS implementations support that?

Instead, routers use the interface addresses advertised in the IS-IS hello packets to determine the next hops for the IP routing table. Building the IP Routing Table Calculating the prefixes that go into the IP routing tables and the next-hop routers is the primary job of the IS-IS SPF algorithm (we covered a few details in the Explore IS-IS Data Structures lab exercise). In this lab exercise, we\u2019ll focus on the next hops of those prefixes. For example, R1 finds three prefixes that go through R3 (the loopback addresses of R3 and R4 and their point-to-point link). Combining that with the IPv4/IPv6 interface address advertised by R3 in the IS-IS hello messages (see above), it installs the following routes in the IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables: IPv4 routes using R3 as the next hop (displayed by R1 running Arista EOS) r1#show ip route isis next-hop 172.16.0.3 ...

Migrating to Unnumbered/LLA-only Interfaces Replace IPv4/IPv6 addresses on all Ethernet interfaces of all routers in your lab with unnumbered IPv4 addresses and link-local-only IPv6. The commands to do that might be similar to no ip address followed by ip address unnumbered loopback 0 and no ipv6 address followed by ipv6 enable . Tip FRRouting: Allows you to configure the same IP address on multiple interfaces. After removing the original Ethernet IPv4 address, use the regular ip address command with the loopback IPv4 address. Does not need the ipv6 enable command; IPv6 is enabled with the sysctl commands, and removing an IPv6 address from an interface does not deactivate IPv6 on that interface. Does It Still Work?

Do they contain the same routes for the loopback interfaces as before? What are the next hops? The IPv4 results might surprise you a bit. For example, Arista EOS claims that the loopback addresses of R2 and R3 are directly connected: The IPv4 routing table on R1 running Arista EOS r1#show ip route isis ...

IS-IS routers cannot establish an adjacency and exchange LSPs without the hello messages, making a passive interface resilient 5 against simple IS-IS spoofing attacks 6 . Considering the potential caveats described in the previous paragraph, a security-focused engineer might prefer route redistribution of connected subnets into IS-IS. Unfortunately, route redistribution brings its own set of caveats: Route redistribution is performed at a single point and has to be controlled by a combination of a route map and prefix lists. IS-IS passive interfaces are granular \u2013 you can decide whether to advertise a subnet into IS-IS on a per-interface basis. Using passive interfaces makes it easier to figure out what subnets are announced into IS-IS. You can set metrics on passive interfaces, for example, when you want to use redundant routers in a primary/backup scenario. While it\u2019s possible to set metrics with redistribution route maps, that requires a more complex route map and several prefix lists 7 . With the IS-IS circuit type, you can easily control whether a subnet on a passive interface is advertised as an L1 or an L2 route (or both). Implementing a similar functionality with a route map is significantly more complex. Finally, IS-IS advertises subnets configured on passive interfaces as internal IS-IS routes and redistributed subnets as external IS-IS routes. While the difference between the two route types is not as extreme as in OSPF (IS-IS routers advertise both route types in the same LSP), there are subtle differences in route preference 8 that could result in amusing 9 troubleshooting scenarios worthy of a CCIE lab.

However, even though a large majority of core Ethernet links connect two routers, you might encounter situations where you have to connect routers to a multi-access network, for example, when building a private WAN network on top of Carrier Ethernet E-LAN service. Like OSPF, IS-IS routers 1 connected to a shared segment elect a Designated Intermediate System (DIS). Unlike OSPF, the DIS is not as crucial to the proper operation of the routing protocol as the OSPF Designated Router is. IS-IS, therefore, does not have a concept of a Backup DIS. DIS failure can still temporarily slow down network convergence ( more details ); it makes sense to ensure that the most stable router (for example, the hub router of a Carrier Ethernet network) becomes DIS. That\u2019s almost impossible to achieve without additional device configuration; when all routers connected to a segment have the same priority, the one with the highest MAC address becomes DIS, and that\u2019s often the last router you bought 2 , not the hub router. Therefore, you should always increase the DIS election priority on hub routers and decrease it on routers you don\u2019t want to use as DIS (spoke routers).

The LAN pseudonode has zero-cost links to all other nodes attached to the LAN , and all LAN nodes advertise a link to the LAN pseudonode It helps other routers detect transmission errors. DIS sends periodic Complete Sequence Number PDU (CSNP) packets. These packets contain the table-of-contents of the DIS LSPDB, and other routers attached to the LAN can use them to discover LSPDB discrepancies. A router that discovers it has an extra bit of information floods it, and a router that\u2019s missing some information requests it with the Partial Sequence Number PDU (PSNP) packet. If a DIS fails, its pseudonode LSP remains in the LSPDB, and the connectivity through the pseudonode is intact until another DIS is elected. At that point, the new DIS advertises a new LAN pseudonode, and all remaining routers change their LSPs to link to it. A change in DIS thus causes no connectivity loss 4 , but it does cause a flurry of LSP changes. Error recovery is more critical. In a perfect world with no transmission errors, a DIS failure doesn\u2019t matter. However, if the LAN segment experiences packet drops, and there\u2019s no DIS to send periodic CSNP packets, the dropped packets won\u2019t be retransmitted until the new DIS is elected and sends the first CSNP packet. DIS failure thus has the potential to impact network convergence. Takeaway: Making DIS stable is not a bad idea, especially on large-scale segments with many routers and a higher probability of packet loss (for example, large Carrier Ethernet deployments).

However, even though a large majority of core Ethernet links connect two routers, you might encounter situations where you have to connect routers to a multi-access network, for example, when building a private WAN network on top of Carrier Ethernet E-LAN service. Like OSPF, IS-IS routers 1 connected to a shared segment elect a Designated Intermediate System (DIS). Unlike OSPF, the DIS is not as crucial to the proper operation of the routing protocol as the OSPF Designated Router is. IS-IS, therefore, does not have a concept of a Backup DIS. DIS failure can still temporarily slow down network convergence ( more details ); it makes sense to ensure that the most stable router (for example, the hub router of a Carrier Ethernet network) becomes DIS. That\u2019s almost impossible to achieve without additional device configuration; when all routers connected to a segment have the same priority, the one with the highest MAC address becomes DIS, and that\u2019s often the last router you bought 2 , not the hub router. Therefore, you should always increase the DIS election priority on hub routers and decrease it on routers you don\u2019t want to use as DIS (spoke routers).

You\u2019ll practice configuring all three in this lab exercise. Device Requirements Use any device supported by the netlab IS-IS configuration module for R1 (default: FRRouting virtual machines or containers). If you want preconfigured passwords for the other three routers (R2, R3, and R4), use FRRouting or Arista EOS. You can use any other device for these routers, but you\u2019ll have to configure the passwords yourself. Automated lab validation requires FRRouting on R2, R3, and R4.

The link between R1 and R2 is a LAN (multi-access) link, the links R1-R3 and R1-R4 are point-to-point links.

The device not using IS-IS authentication can claim full adjacency with its neighbors.

Let\u2019s fix it. Configuration Tasks Configure the following IS-IS passwords using authentication or password interface- or router configuration commands 3 : Password type Password Interface ForgetMeNot Area MyAreaOnly Domain RemoteFriend Validation You can use the netlab validate command if you run FRRouting on R2, R3, and R4. The validation process checks the IS-IS adjacency using IS-IS hostnames. The validation will succeed on R2 and R3 if you configured the interface password (otherwise, the IS-IS adjacency is not established) and the area password (otherwise, R2 and R3 see adjacent system ID 0000.0000.0001 but do not know it is R1). You must configure the domain password for the validation to succeed on R4. For example, this is the printout you would get after configuring the interface- and area passwords: You could also do manual validation: After configuring the interface passwords, all IS-IS adjacencies should be in UP state on all routers.

Each leaf has two equal-cost paths to every other leaf, resulting in a pretty optimal traffic distribution across all core links. Next, assume you must do some maintenance on S1. Turning it off would disrupt the traffic between L1 and L2 until they realize S1 is gone and the convergence process does its job ( more details ). Is there a way to drain the traffic from the spine switch before turning it off? You\u2019ll explore that in this lab exercise. Device Requirements Use any device supported by the netlab IS-IS configuration module for the routers in your lab (default: FRRouting virtual machines or containers). You can do automated lab validation with FRRouting running on L1 and L2. Starting the Lab You can start the lab on your own lab infrastructure or in GitHub Codespaces ( more details ): Change directory to feature/5-drain Execute netlab up . You\u2019ll get a lab with IPv4 addresses configured on all interfaces and level-2 IS-IS routing configured on all routers. Log into lab routers with netlab connect and verify their configuration. The Problem Every leaf switch has two equal-cost paths to every other leaf switch. For example L1 uses S1 and S2 to reach the loopback interface of L2: Routes toward the loopback interface of L2 on L1 running FRRouting $ netlab connect -q l1 --show ip route 10.0.0.4 Routing entry for 10.0.0.4/32 Known via \"isis\", distance 115, metric 30, best Last update 00:01:17 ago * 10.1.0.2, via eth1, weight 1 * 10.1.0.6, via eth2, weight 1 If you shut down S1, the routes using S1 (next hop 10.1.0.2) remain in the routing (and forwarding) table of L1 until L1 discovers it lost the link toward S1. That might be pretty fast if you can rely on the physical link-loss signal or take seconds if your only failure detection mechanism is the IS-IS hello protocol. Regardless of the failure detection time, there will be some traffic disruption. Draining Traffic from an IS-IS Router We\u2019re using the maximum metric functionality in OSPF networks to solve a similar problem; if an OSPF router advertises all its links with a high metric, all other routers eventually find a better path, and the router is no longer used for transit traffic. While some IS-IS implementations have a similar configuration command (for example, advertise-high-metrics on FRRouting), the IS-IS designers decided to take an even better approach years before OSPF got the maximum metric functionality: the IS-IS LSPs contain an overload bit that a router can use to tell everyone else to avoid it for transit traffic. Setting the overload bit on S1 enables a clean shutdown. As the other routers receive and flood S1 LSP across the network, they recompute their best paths and remove routes using S1 (or replace them with alternate paths). Tip Abruptly increasing interface metrics or setting the overload bit could cause transient micro-loops in complex networks due to the asynchronous nature of IS-IS path computation. Fortunately, we won\u2019t experience micro-loops in our fabric, as we always have multiple equal-cost paths between the leaf switches. At least one academic team published a paper describing an algorithm for computing a series of gradual metric increases that avoids micro-loops. However, I don\u2019t know anyone using that approach in a production network. Configuration Tasks Configure the overload bit in the IS-IS process of S1. Tip You\u2019re running a dual-stack network; some devices (for example, FRRouting) can set the overload bit for individual address families. Check what your devices are doing, or you might drain IPv4 traffic but leave IPv6 intact. Check also the IS-IS high metric functionality on devices that support it as an alternative to the overload bit and in combination with it, and explore the resulting changes in the S1\u2019s IS-IS LSP, IS-IS topology, and IP routing table. Validation You can use the netlab validate command if you\u2019re using netlab release 1.8.4 or later and run FRRouting on L1 and L2. This is the printout you\u2019d get if you failed to configure the overload bit: You could also do manual validation of the routing tables on L1 and L2: There should be a single path (through S2) for the other leaf router\u2019s IPv4 and IPv6 loopback prefixes. The IPv4 and IPv6 loopback prefixes of S1 should still be reachable (because it\u2019s not a transit route through S1).

Some implementations allow you to set the overload bit for a fixed amount of time; others are more flexible and can wait for the initial BGP convergence to complete before clearing the overload bit. Finally, some implementors returned to the fundamentals and started using the overload bit for what it was initially designed to do: signal to the rest of the network that the router has performance problems (for example, running out of RAM due to a memory leak) and should be avoided.

While some IS-IS implementations have a similar configuration command (for example, advertise-high-metrics on FRRouting), the IS-IS designers decided to take an even better approach years before OSPF got the maximum metric functionality: the IS-IS LSPs contain an overload bit that a router can use to tell everyone else to avoid it for transit traffic. Setting the overload bit on S1 enables a clean shutdown. As the other routers receive and flood S1 LSP across the network, they recompute their best paths and remove routes using S1 (or replace them with alternate paths). Tip Abruptly increasing interface metrics or setting the overload bit could cause transient micro-loops in complex networks due to the asynchronous nature of IS-IS path computation. Fortunately, we won\u2019t experience micro-loops in our fabric, as we always have multiple equal-cost paths between the leaf switches. At least one academic team published a paper describing an algorithm for computing a series of gradual metric increases that avoids micro-loops.

While setting these timers to low values is tempting, you always have to find the right balance between convergence speed, routing protocol overhead (excessive flooding and CPU utilization), and network instability due to overly quick reactions to partially updated information ( example ). These are the usual timers you can tweak: SPF interval This parameter changes the maximum interval between SPF runs. It directly impacts the convergence speed and is set to conservative values in implementations with enough history, as they had to work on very slow CPUs. Most modern IS-IS implementations use reasonable values for SPF interval. LSP generation The interval between the generation of changed LSPs. This parameter should not be set too low, as it prevents your router from flooding the network with too many changes generated by a flapping interface. However, it might also impact the speed with which changes in network topology or redistributed routes are advertised in IS-IS. CSNP generation IS-IS uses periodic CSNP packets (table-of-contents of the LSP database) to detect missing information. Sending them more often will improve recovery from lost LSP updates. However, if the LSP packet loss significantly impacts your network convergence, you have much bigger problems to fix than the CSNP interval.

Configure redistribution of connected subnets into IS-IS on R2. Warning Some IS-IS implementations (for example, FRR) refuse to redistribute the default route into IS-IS. The only way to originate a default route is with the default-information originate command. While configuring the route redistribution, try to: Redistribute routes only into the level-2 LSP database Set a high metric (for example, 3000) on the redistributed routes. Tip Some IS-IS implementations (for example, Arista EOS) can redistribute external routes only into the level-2 database. Validation You can use the netlab validate command when using FRRouting on R1 and R2. This is the printout you\u2019d get after configuring default route redistribution on R1 while forgetting the redistribution of connected interfaces on R2. You could also do manual validation of the routing tables on R1 and R2: The prefix 172.16.42.0/24 should be in the R1 routing table The prefixes 0.0.0.0/0 and 172.16.0.0/16 should be in the R2 routing table. X1 should be able to ping X2. Use the netlab connect x2 ping x1 command if you don\u2019t want to be bothered with Linux details. You could inspect the details of individual LSPs in the LSP database and verify that the redistributed routes are not in the level-1 LSPs. Behind the Scenes Inspect the LSP database after configuring the route redistribution. The number of LSPs has not changed; each router still advertises a single LSP. Contrary to OSPF (which uses LSA type-5 for external routes), IS-IS includes redistributed routes into the router LSP, and there\u2019s no difference between an external route and an internal one 5 .

On the other hand, there\u2019s a hard limit on how many routes a single router can redistribute into IS-IS. The nightmare BGP-to-OSPF FUBARs are way less damaging in IS-IS. Some IS-IS implementations can set additional attributes on external IS-IS routes.

Configuration Tasks Enable BFD on R2 and R3 (not needed on some devices) Enable BFD for IS-IS (usually with an interface command like isis bfd ). On some platforms, you might have to enable BFD for IPv4 and IPv6 separately 7 . Other platforms (for example, FRRouting) have a single command, but run BFD in a single address family. Tip While running BFD for IPv4 and IPv6 is recommended 8 , it might not be strictly necessary. Some platforms bring down IS-IS adjacency after a single BFD session failure; others will just note that one of the address families is unavailable in their IS-IS hellos and LSPs. If possible, tweak the BFD timers. The configuration differs widely between platforms. While many implementations have an interface configuration command similar to bfd interval , you must configure a BFD profile on FRRouting and apply it to IS-IS on each interface.
