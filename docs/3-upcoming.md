# Upcoming Labs

We just started the project, and all we can show is a list of ideas. Here they are:

Start the IS-IS Routing
: * Configure an IS-IS routing process
  * Assign an NET
  * Enable IS-IS on interfaces

IS-IS on Point-to-Point Links
: * Explore how long it takes for IS-IS to establish adjacency
  * Change the link to a point-to-point link

Using IS-IS Metrics
: * Change IS-IS metrics to avoid a backup link
  * If available, test the transitional and wide metrics

Dual-Stack IS-IS Routing
: * Enable IS-IS for IPv4 and IPv6
  * Explore single-topology and multi-topology behavior

Optimize IS-IS Adjacencies
: * Change the adjacencies to L2-only
  * Explain the difference between L1+L2 and L2-only adjacencies

Passive IS-IS Interfaces
: * Explain the need for passive interfaces
  * Configure passive IS-IS interfaces

Influence the Designated IS Election
: * Explain the need for DIS priority
	* Configure DIS priority on a router

Protect IS-IS Adjacencies with MD5 Authentication
: * Configure IS-IS area- and interface passwords

Route Redistribution into IS-IS
: * Configure static route and connected interface redistribution into IS-IS

Multi-Level IS-IS Networks
: * Explain intra-area and inter-area routing
  * Configure a network with multiple areas and L1/L2 routers

Fast IS-IS Failure Detection and Convergence
: * Configure IS-IS timers
  * Use BFD

Graceful Shutdown with IS-IS Overload Bit
: * Configure IS-IS overload bit or maximum metric to drain traffic from a transit router

Build an SR-MPLS Network with IS-IS
: * Build a BGP-free MPLS core using SR-MPLS with IS-IS

Configure IS-IS Fast Reroute Using TI-LFA
: * In a triangle network, configure the longer path as a backup path

Using IS-IS with SRv6
: * Build a BGP-free IPv6 core using SRv6 for end-to-end transport
