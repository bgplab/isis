# Upcoming Labs

A large number of IS-IS labs are [already online](index.md), but we keep getting interesting ideas ([example](https://github.com/bgplab/isis/issues/4)). Here are some of them:

## Advanced Labs

The Impact of IS-IS Area Partitioning
: * Explain suboptimal routing within a poorly-designed area (L1 routes are preferred over L2 routes)
  * Explore what happens when an area partitions

Securing Multi-Level Networks at the Area Level
:  * Use level-specific passwords

Explore LSP Database Behavior
: * What happens when an LSP is changed?
  * How is an LSP removed from a database?
  * What happens on network partitioning?

Using IS-IS with SRv6
: * Build a BGP-free IPv6 core using SRv6 for end-to-end transport

Two-Way Redistribution
: * Redistribute routes between OSPF and IS-IS at multiple points
  * Use route filters to prevent routing loops

## Troubleshooting

Troubleshoot IS-IS Adjacencies
: This lab will include the most common mistakes that prevent an IS-IS adjacency from forming, including:

  * MTU mismatch
  * L1/L2 mismatch
  * Area mismatch on L1 adjacency
  * 3-way handshake on point-to-point links
