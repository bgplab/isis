# Upcoming Labs

The [first few labs are already online](index.md); the list of ideas is much longer. Here they are:

## Configure IS-IS Features

Protect IS-IS Adjacencies with MD5 Authentication
: * Configure IS-IS area- and interface passwords

Route Redistribution into IS-IS
: * Configure static route and connected interface redistribution into IS-IS

Fast IS-IS Failure Detection and Convergence
: * Configure IS-IS timers
  * Use BFD

Minimize IS-IS Routing Tables
: * Turn off the advertisement of inter-router prefixes

IS-IS on Unnumbered Interfaces
: * Explore IS-IS running on point-to-point and multi-access unnumbered IPv4 interfaces and IPv6 LLA-only interfaces

## Advanced Labs

Multi-Level IS-IS Networks
: * Explain intra-area and inter-area routing
  * Configure a network with multiple areas and L1/L2 routers

Graceful Shutdown with IS-IS Overload Bit
: * Configure IS-IS overload bit or maximum metric to drain traffic from a transit router

Build an SR-MPLS Network with IS-IS
: * Build a BGP-free MPLS core using SR-MPLS with IS-IS

Configure IS-IS Fast Reroute Using TI-LFA
: * In a triangle network, configure the longer path as a backup path

Using IS-IS with SRv6
: * Build a BGP-free IPv6 core using SRv6 for end-to-end transport

## Troubleshooting

Troubleshoot IS-IS Adjacencies
: This lab will include the most common mistakes that prevent an IS-IS adjacency from forming, including:

  * MTU mismatch
  * L1/L2 mismatch
  * Area mismatch on L1 adjacency
  * 3-way handshake on point-to-point links
