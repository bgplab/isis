# Open-Source IS-IS Configuration Labs

This series of hands-on labs will help you master the IS-IS routing protocol configuration on a [platform of your choice](https://netlab.tools/platforms/#platform-routing-support)[^PC], including:

* Arista EOS
* Cisco ASAv, IOSv, IOS XE, IOS XR and Nexus OS
* FRRouting
* Dell OS10
* Juniper vSRX, vMX and vPTX
* Nokia SR OS and SR Linux
* Vyatta VyOS

[^PC]: Some assembly required: the virtual machines or containers that we recommend to use as external IS-IS speakers are easy to download, but you'll have to build a Vagrant box or install a vendor-supplied Vagrant box or Docker container image for most other platforms. See [installation and setup](1-setup.md) for details.

!!! tip
    If this is your first visit to this site, you should start with the [Installation and Setup](1-setup.md) documentation or [run labs in GitHub codespaces](4-codespaces.md).

The initial lab exercises will help you configure basic IS-IS features:

* [Work with FRRouting](basic/0-frrouting.md) (optional)
* [Start the IS-IS Routing for IPv4](basic/1-simple-ipv4.md)
* [Explore IS-IS Data Structures](basic/2-explore.md)
* [IS-IS on Point-to-Point Links](basic/3-p2p.md)
* [Using IS-IS Metrics](basic/4-metric.md)
* [Dual-Stack (IPv4+IPv6) IS-IS Routing](basic/5-ipv6.md)
* [Optimize Simple IS-IS Deployments](basic/6-level-2.md)
