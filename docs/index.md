# Open-Source IS-IS Configuration Labs

This series of hands-on labs will help you master the IS-IS routing protocol configuration on a [platform of your choice](https://netlab.tools/platforms/#platform-routing-support)[^PC], including:

* Arista EOS
* Cisco ASAv, IOSv, IOS XE, IOS XR and Nexus OS
* FRRouting
* Dell OS10
* Juniper vSRX, vMX and vPTX
* Nokia SR OS and SR Linux
* Vyatta VyOS

[^PC]: Some assembly required: the virtual machines or containers that we recommend to use as external IS-IS speakers are easy to download, but you'll have to build a Vagrant box or install a vendor-supplied Vagrant box or Docker container image for most other platforms. See [installation and setup](1-setup.md) for details.

!!! tip
    If this is your first visit to this site, you should start with the [Installation and Setup](1-setup.md) documentation or [run labs in GitHub codespaces](4-codespaces.md).

The initial lab exercises will help you configure basic IS-IS features:

* [Work with FRRouting](basic/0-frrouting.md)
* [Start the IS-IS Routing for IPv4](basic/1-simple-ipv4.md)
* Explore the IS-IS Database (coming soon)
* IS-IS on Point-to-Point Links (coming soon)
* Using IS-IS Metrics (coming soon)
* Dual-Stack IS-IS Routing (coming soon)
* Optimize IS-IS Adjacencies (coming soon)
* Troubleshoot IS-IS Adjacencies (coming soon)
