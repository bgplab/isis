# IS-IS on Point-to-Point Links

In the [Configure IS-IS Routing for IPv4](1-simple-ipv4.md) lab exercise, I told you to configure the links as point-to-point links and promised a detailed explanation in a follow-up lab exercise. We got that far; let's see why using point-to-point links on Ethernet interfaces makes sense.

To keep things simple, we'll use the simplest possible lab topology: two routers connected with a single link.

## Device Requirements

Use any device [supported by the _netlab_ IS-IS configuration module](https://netlab.tools/platforms/#platform-routing-support).

## Starting the Lab

Assuming you already [set up your lab infrastructure](../1-setup.md):

* Change directory to `basic/3-p2p`
* Execute **netlab up**
* Log into lab devices with **netlab connect**

## Point-to-Point and Multi-Access Links

Like OSPF, IS-IS supports point-to-point (P2P) and multi-access links. Point-to-point links were traditionally used on P2P WAN links; all other media types (LAN, but also multi-access WAN like Frame Relay) used multi-access links. That's still the default behavior you get on most platforms.

Multi-access links have two drawbacks when compared to point-to-point links:

* The IS-IS topology database contains extra objects (LSPs) describing LAN links.
* The routers on a multi-access link must elect a Designated Intermediate System[^DIS], prolonging the adjacency establishment process[^OCT]. Like OSPF, the election process considers router priority and its System ID. Unlike OSPF, there is no Backup DIS in IS-IS; routers connected to a multi-access link elect a new DIS when the current one is gone.

[^DIS]: *Intermediate System* is an OSI-compliant word for a router. OSPF would call DIS a DR.

[^OCT]: And consequently, the overall convergence time after a link recovery.

## Exploring Multi-Access Database Structures

It's time to get our hands dirty. Log into one of the lab devices and examine its IS-IS database. You should get a printout similar to this one. Please note an extra LSP (the description of the LAN subnet generated by R2):

```
r1# show isis database
Area Gandalf:
IS-IS Level-2 link-state database:
LSP ID                  PduLen  SeqNumber   Chksum  Holdtime  ATT/P/OL
r1.00-00             *     92   0x00000005  0xc392    1164    0/0/0
r2.00-00                   92   0x00000005  0x60ef    1167    0/0/0
r2.74-00                   51   0x00000003  0x5202    1239    0/0/0
```

Let's inspect the extra LSP. It looks very similar to an OSPF type-2 LSA:

* It describes links from the LAN segment to individual routers.
* Unlike OSPF type-2 LSA, it does not contain the LAN prefix.

```
r1# show isis database detail r2.74-00
Area Gandalf:
IS-IS Level-2 link-state database:
LSP ID                  PduLen  SeqNumber   Chksum  Holdtime  ATT/P/OL
r2.74-00                   51   0x00000003  0x5202    1130    0/0/0
  Extended Reachability: 0000.0000.0002.00 (Metric: 0)
  Extended Reachability: 0000.0000.0001.00 (Metric: 0)
```

!!! tip
    The core IS-IS data structures are protocol-agnostic. Protocol-specific prefixes are advertised as part of the router LSP.

Not surprisingly, the routers connected to the LAN segment advertise their links to the LAN segment and the LAN IPv4 prefix. This is what R1 has to say:

```
r1# show isis database detail r1.00-00
Area Gandalf:
IS-IS Level-2 link-state database:
LSP ID                  PduLen  SeqNumber   Chksum  Holdtime  ATT/P/OL
r1.00-00             *     92   0x00000006  0xc193    1780    0/0/0
  Protocols Supported: IPv4
  Area Address: 49.0001
  Hostname: r1
  TE Router ID: 10.0.0.1
  Router Capability: 10.0.0.1 , D:0, S:0
  Extended Reachability: 0000.0000.0002.74 (Metric: 10)
  IPv4 Interface Address: 10.0.0.1
  Extended IP Reachability: 10.0.0.1/32 (Metric: 10)
  Extended IP Reachability: 10.1.0.0/30 (Metric: 10)
```

!!! tip
    It's worth noting that the router LSP does not specify the interface on which a particular IP prefix is; it just claims that the router knows how to reach the prefix with the specified cost. That's enough to find the optimum paths to all prefixes in the network[^PLER]

[^PLER]: The proof is left as an exercise for the reader.

## Using Point-to-Point Links

Core Ethernet links in modern networks are usually point-to-point links[^CE] between routers[^L3S]. Modeling those links as multi-access networks makes no sense, yet most IS-IS implementations use that approach on all LAN interfaces.

[^CE]: A major exception: routers connected to a Carrier Ethernet E-LAN service.

[^L3S]: The devices also known as *layer-3 switches* in marketing collaterals.

Use an interface configuration command similar to **isis network point-to-point** to tell IS-IS to treat an interface like a point-to-point link. Do that on both routers in your network. 

!!! tip
    While changing the interface type, you might observe logging/error messages similar to `p2p hello on non p2p circuit` or `lan hello on non broadcast circuit`[^TM].
    
[^TM]: On many network devices, you must enable message logging on terminal sessions with a command similar to **terminal monitor**.

Let's inspect the IS-IS topology database after the change. As expected, it contains two LSPs (one per router).

```
r1# show isis database
Area Gandalf:
IS-IS Level-2 link-state database:
LSP ID                  PduLen  SeqNumber   Chksum  Holdtime  ATT/P/OL
r1.00-00             *     92   0x00000008  0x5d6a    1598    0/0/0
r2.00-00                   92   0x00000009  0xd4ec    1558    0/0/0
```

The LSPs describe the direct connection between the routers. For example, R1 claims it's directly connected to R2[^HNM]:

[^HNM]: FRR printouts are a bit inconsistent. Router names are displayed in high-level printouts, while the detailed printouts contain system IDs. Use the **show isis hostname** command to display the mapping between system IDs and hostnames.

```
r1# show isis database detail r1.00-00
Area Gandalf:
IS-IS Level-2 link-state database:
LSP ID                  PduLen  SeqNumber   Chksum  Holdtime  ATT/P/OL
r1.00-00             *     92   0x00000008  0x5d6a    1533    0/0/0
  Protocols Supported: IPv4
  Area Address: 49.0001
  Hostname: r1
  TE Router ID: 10.0.0.1
  Router Capability: 10.0.0.1 , D:0, S:0
  Extended Reachability: 0000.0000.0002.00 (Metric: 10)
  IPv4 Interface Address: 10.0.0.1
  Extended IP Reachability: 10.0.0.1/32 (Metric: 10)
  Extended IP Reachability: 10.1.0.0/30 (Metric: 10)
```

## Three-Way Handshake

Original IS-IS specifications used a simple HELLO protocol: whenever a router received an Intermediate System Hello (ISH) from an adjacent router, it assumed the adjacent router could be reached, resulting in miserable failures on unidirectional links[^MFMD].

[^MFMD]: See the introduction section of [RFC 5303](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5303) for more details.

That hurdle was removed with the three-way handshake defined in [RFC 5303](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5303). That RFC specifies a new IS-IS option (Point-to-Point Three-Way Adjacency) that contains the System ID of the adjacent device, allowing IS-IS routers to verify they have a two-way communication[^3WO].

[^3WO]: OSPF has had similar functionality since its early days. Its hello packet contains the list of neighbors a router can see on an interface.

Modern IS-IS implementations use the three-way handshake by default. Still, you might have to turn it off to interoperate with an older device (or a device with ancient defaults) with an interface command similar to **no isis three-way-handshake**[^NAA].

[^NAA]: RFC 5303 was published in 2008, and recent IS-IS implementations, for example, Arista EOS, no longer have that nerd knob.

!!! warning
    A mismatch in the three-way handshake setting could have bizarre results. For example, turning it off on a FRRouting device results in one of the neighbors having a fully operational IS-IS adjacency while, at the same time, the other neighbor claims it can see no neighbors. To make matters worse, that often happens only after the IS-IS adjacency has been lost and would have to be re-established.

As the last task in this lab, try out how your devices react to a three-way-handshake mismatch (assuming you can configure it):

* Turn it off on one of the routers.
* Clear the IS-IS adjacency with a command similar to **clear isis neighbor**
* Enjoy the confusing logging messages.
